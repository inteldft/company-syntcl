* Description
This package contains two company completion backends, one for
Synopsys Tcl the other for netlist completion.They can be used
independently. Both rely on JSON data provided by
=WriteTclCompleteFiles.tcl= which is hosted in another repo.


* Create the JSON data
Clone the vim based TCL complete repo at
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/cbheitho/TclComplete
#+END_SRC

Under the tcl directory there is a file =WriteTclCompleteFiles.tcl=.
This will need to be sourced in a Synopsys shell to generate the JSON
completion data. See the original repo for full details.

* Usage
Install [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company mode]] from Melpa. Enable company mode in Tcl buffers or
globally.

To enable Synopsys completion add the following to your init file
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-syntcl)
#+END_SRC

To enable netlist completion, add the following to your init file
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-netlist)
#+END_SRC
